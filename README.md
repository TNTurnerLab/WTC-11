This repository holds information regarding our assessment of whole-genome sequencing data on WTC-11. We are adding this repository since we have been asked a few times about our copy number variant assessment of the cell line data.

### Original Data Source
The data for this cell line comes from the Allen Institute for Cell Science. The genomics data is available at [https://www.allencell.org/genomics.html](https://www.allencell.org/genomics.html).
